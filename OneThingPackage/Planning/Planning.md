#  Planning

* Go through each view and review dynamic text size and long names
* Backend audit
* Frontend audit
* Add more todos to .previewSeed (ask chatgpt)
* New app name
* moving todos should rerank them at end of list
* more tests

# Future
* Make Dashboard search bar a circle button instead in bottom right
* Soft-delete lists
* Add support for FTS5 (full text search)
* Make Dashboard edit button use checkmark on iOS 26
* When entering edit mode on Dashboard, Scheduled list animates from leading edge when the 
others don't
* In Dashboard, list rows should have context menus: Edit, Delete
* Dashboard edit mode should allow batch deleting lists instead of changing tap behavior
* In list detail and computed lists, while in edit mode you can batch delete, move todos
