#  Planning

* Improve date-to-string formatting (ex: tomorrow, next thursday)
* Add support for FTS5 (full text search)
* Make edit button use checkmark on iOS 26
* When entering edit mode on Dashboard, Scheduled list animates from leading edge when the 
others don't
* Make all Text have rounded font + line limit
* Thorough review of DashboardView
* Add more todos to .previewSeed (ask chatgpt)
* Create DisplayTodos and DisplayLists for views, instead of passing around raw Todos and TodoLists
* Make Dashboard search bar a circle button instead in bottom right
* Sheet model stored in parent view, causing unwanted persistence of state
* New app name


# Features
